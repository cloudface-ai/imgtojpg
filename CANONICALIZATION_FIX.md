# Fixing URL Canonicalization Issues on Render

## Problem Description
You're experiencing URL canonicalization issues where sometimes the Hostinger default page shows up instead of your site content, despite having canonical URLs set up. Since you're hosting on **Render** (not Hostinger), we need to handle redirects at the application level.

## Root Causes

### 1. **Missing Application-Level Redirects**
- Canonical tags alone don't redirect users
- Render needs Express.js redirects to enforce canonicalization
- Without redirects, multiple URLs can serve the same content

### 2. **www vs non-www Confusion**
- `www.imgtojpg.org` and `imgtojpg.org` might serve different content
- Search engines see these as different sites
- DNS might point to different locations

### 3. **File Extension Variations**
- `/about` vs `/about.html` vs `/about/`
- No redirects to canonical versions
- Multiple URLs serving same content

### 4. **DNS and Hosting Confusion**
- Domain registered with Hostinger
- Website hosted on Render
- DNS configuration might cause routing issues

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Added Express.js Redirects in server.js**
```javascript
// Canonicalization redirects - Handle URL variations and redirects
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  const host = req.get('host');
  const protocol = req.protocol;
  const url = req.url;
  
  // Force HTTPS
  if (protocol === 'http') {
    return res.redirect(301, `https://${host}${url}`);
  }
  
  // Force non-www (imgtojpg.org instead of www.imgtojpg.org)
  if (host.startsWith('www.')) {
    const newHost = host.replace('www.', '');
    return res.redirect(301, `https://${newHost}${url}`);
  }
  
  // Handle .html extensions and clean URLs
  if (url.endsWith('.html') && url !== '/index.html') {
    const cleanUrl = url.replace('.html', '');
    return res.redirect(301, cleanUrl);
  }
  
  // Handle index.html redirects
  if (url === '/index.html') {
    return res.redirect(301, '/');
  }
  
  // Handle common URL variations
  const urlVariations = {
    '/home': '/',
    '/homepage': '/',
    '/heic-to-jpg': '/heic-to-jpg.html',
    '/png-to-jpg': '/png-to-jpg.html',
    // ... more variations
  };
  
  if (urlVariations[url]) {
    return res.redirect(301, urlVariations[url]);
  }
  
  next();
});
```

### 2. **Updated Canonical URLs**
- Added multiple canonical variations
- Ensured consistency across all pages
- Added hreflang attributes for international SEO

### 3. **Enhanced robots.txt**
- Added canonical URL guidance
- Specified preferred domain format
- Clear directives for search engines

### 4. **Comprehensive Sitemap**
- All important URLs included
- Proper priority and change frequency
- Helps search engines understand site structure

## How to Deploy the Fix

### Step 1: Commit and Push Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add URL canonicalization redirects for Render"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Render Build Process
1. **Automatic Build**: Render detects changes and starts building
2. **Dependencies**: Installs Node.js packages
3. **Asset Building**: Runs CSS and JavaScript minification
4. **Deployment**: Serves optimized files with redirects

### Step 3: Verify Deployment
- Check build logs in Render dashboard
- Verify redirects are working
- Test website performance

## Expected Results

### ✅ **After Fix:**
- All URLs redirect to canonical versions
- No more Hostinger default pages
- Consistent user experience
- Better SEO rankings
- Proper canonicalization

### ❌ **Before Fix:**
- Multiple URLs serving same content
- Hostinger default pages appearing
- SEO confusion and duplicate content
- Inconsistent user experience

## Testing Your Fix

### 1. **Test Redirects After Deployment**
Test these URLs to ensure they redirect properly:
- `http://imgtojpg.org` → `https://imgtojpg.org`
- `https://www.imgtojpg.org` → `https://imgtojpg.org`
- `https://imgtojpg.org/index.html` → `https://imgtojpg.org/`
- `https://imgtojpg.org/about` → `https://imgtojpg.org/about.html`

### 2. **Check Browser Developer Tools**
- Network tab shows redirects
- Response headers show 301 status
- Final URL is canonical version

### 3. **Use Online Tools**
- [Redirect Checker](https://redirect-checker.org/)
- [HTTP Status Checker](https://httpstatus.io/)
- [SEO Site Checkup](https://seositecheckup.com/)

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Redirects Not Working After Deployment
**Solution**: Wait 5-10 minutes for Render to deploy, clear browser cache

### Issue: Still Seeing Hostinger Page
**Solution**: Check DNS settings, ensure domain points to Render, not Hostinger

### Issue: HTTPS Redirects Not Working
**Solution**: Verify SSL certificate is properly configured on Render

### Issue: www Redirects Not Working
**Solution**: Check DNS A records, ensure both www and non-www point to Render

## DNS Configuration Check

### 1. **Verify DNS Records**
In your Hostinger domain management:
- **A Record**: `@` → Your Render IP address
- **A Record**: `www` → Your Render IP address
- **CNAME**: `www` → Your Render domain (if using CNAME)

### 2. **Render Domain Settings**
In Render dashboard:
- Ensure custom domain is properly configured
- SSL certificate is active
- Domain verification is complete

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### 1. **Regular Checks**
- Test redirects monthly
- Monitor search console for canonicalization issues
- Check for new duplicate content

### 2. **Performance Impact**
- Redirects add minimal latency
- 301 redirects are cached by browsers
- Overall performance improvement due to canonicalization

### 3. **SEO Benefits**
- Eliminates duplicate content
- Consolidates link equity
- Improves search rankings
- Better user experience

## Troubleshooting Checklist

- [ ] Code changes committed and pushed to Git
- [ ] Render deployment completed successfully
- [ ] DNS records point to Render (not Hostinger)
- [ ] SSL certificate active on Render
- [ ] Redirects tested with multiple URLs
- [ ] Search console updated
